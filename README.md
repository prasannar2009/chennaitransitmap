# Chennai Metro and Suburban Rail Map (Future Concept)

Design for a transit map of Chennai at the end of Phase 2 construction (expected to be 2026)

## Design Elements

- The tamil letters ஆ and ல are inconrporated into the design. With ஆல meaning Banyan (tree), it makes for an apt reference to a transit network with many roots / branches
- Tamil and English are both included in the same map as opposed to two separate monolingual maps. With monolingual maps, the English version usually ends up dominating in the public sphere and the Tamil map gradually gets forgotten about. Having both side-by-side also helps one to (consciously or subconsciously) learn the other language if one wishes.
- The lines are drawn with large rounded angles and with minimal turns helping the eyes to follow and create a desired route easily. 

## Updates

Hope to keep this work updated as construction progresses with the correct station names and additional info.
